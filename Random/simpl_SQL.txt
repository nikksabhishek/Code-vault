Given a transactions table: TRANSACTION_ID,USER_ID,MERCHANT_NAME,TRANSACTION_DATE,AMOUNT 
1.  a. Write a query to find the first merchant a user transacts on 
    b. Extract count of users who transacted for the first time on a Monday for each merchant 
2. Write a query to extract alternate rows ordered by date for each user. 
3. Write a query to extract top 25% of users based on amount spent. 
4. Write a query to calculate time difference (in days) between current and previous order of each customer 
    for every row and the avg time difference between two orders for every customer. 
5. Write a query to get count of users who transact in 3 continuous months.

SOLUTIONS :

1. A) SELECT USER_ID,MERCHANT_NAME
      FROM ( SELECT USER_ID,MERCHANT_NAME, row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY USER_ID ORDER BY TRANSACTION_DATE ASC ) as Rank 
             FROM TRNSCT_TABLE D) 
      WHERE Rank = 1')

      For a date range : Between operator to be used.

   B)  SELECT MERCHANT_NAME,count(*) as 'USER_COUNT' 
       FROM (SELECT * FROM TRNSCT_TABLE GROUP BY USER_ID HAVING COUNT(*) = 1) 
       WHERE (DATENAME(DW,TRANSACTION_DATE)='Monday') 
       GROUP BY MERCHANT_NAME, USER_ID 
       ORDER BY MERCHANT_NAME

2.  SELECT USER_ID, MERCHANT_NAME, TRANSACTION_DATE
    FROM (SELECT *, row_number() over(ORDER BY USER_ID, TRANSACTION_DATE) AS RANK FROM TRNSCT_TABLE) 
    WHERE (RANK % 2) = 0 

3.  SELECT TOP(25) PERCENT
    TRANSACTION_ID,USER_ID,MERCHANT_NAME,TRANSACTION_DATE,AMOUNT
    FROM TRNSCT_TABLE
    ORDER BY AMOUNT

4 . SELECT A.*
    , DATEDIFF(DAY
    , A.TRANSACTION_DATE
    , B.TRANSACTION_DATE) as DATEDIFF_BETWEEN_ORDERS
    , AVG(DATEDIFF(HOUR, A.TRANSACTION_DATE, B.TRANSACTION_DATE)) as AVGDATEDIFF_BETWEEN_ORDERS
    FROM TRNSCT_TABLE  AS A, 
    LEFT JOIN TRNSCT_TABLE  AS B
    ON A.USER_ID = B.USER_ID +1
    WHERE A.TRANSACTION_DATE IS NOT NULL AND B.TRANSACTION_DATE IS NOT NULL

5 . SELECT * 
    FROM TRNSCT_TABLE 
    WHERE TRANSACTION_DATE IS NOT NULL AND 
        DATEDIFF(month, ISNULL(TRANSACTION_DATE, DATEADD(month, -3, GetDate())), GetDate()) > 2
